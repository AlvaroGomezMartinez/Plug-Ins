# OmniFocus Custom Plugins
This repository contains plugins that I created to automate task organization on my OmniFocus app.<br>
## Workflow
A Google filter is set in my Gmail account that forwards emails containing Google Apps Script project specific error messages in the subject line to my OmniFocus account. The emails are automatically labeled and archived under each project's folder. This keeps my Gmail inbox clean. When I open my OmniFocus inbox and see the forwarded tasks, I will run the custom plugins which automates moving the tasks to its project and tagging it. The plugins are located in the OmniFocus toolbar. I will action the tasks (schedule or delete) when I'm doing my weekly planning.
